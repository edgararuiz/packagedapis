This package explores the mechanics of managing APIs within an R package.  The idea is to separate the functions and the API endpoint code. This will allow to also test the functions and the endpoints independently.  The idea is for the R package test and checks will test the endpoints as part of the verification process. 

## Please clone, don't install

This package is meant to be an example for those who want to develop a package to maintain their APIs.  The best way to take advantage of it is to clone the repo, and then try running the tests and checks locally.
